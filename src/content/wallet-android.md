## Mobile Garlicoin Wallet
This is an unofficial Android wallet which allows you to check your balance anywhere.  
It is only a watcher wallet, meaning that your private keys are not stored in the app. As a result, you can't use it to pay, but checking your balance and transactions is still very useful.
