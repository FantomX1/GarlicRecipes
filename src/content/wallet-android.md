<h2>Mobile Garlicoin Wallet</h2>
<br>

This is an unofficial Android wallet which allows you to check your balance anywhere.  
It is only a watcher wallet, meaning that your private keys are not stored in the app. As a result, you can't use it to pay, but checking your balance and transactions is still very useful.

You can learn more about it and download it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/garlicoin/comments/7vr51u/devupdate_mobile_garlicoin_wallet/).
